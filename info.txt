HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS

1. Load the Excel file:
The pandas library's read_excel function is used to read the Excel file bookForTesting.xlsx located in C:/testing/. The file's content is 
stored in the products_df DataFrame.

2. Generate combinations:
the generate_combinations function is called with the products_df DataFrame. This function generates combinations 
of product variations based on the product's attributes such as color, logo color, and location.
Let's break down the generate_combinations function:
a) It loops through each row in the products_df DataFrame. For each product (each row), it extracts the post_title (product name), 
sku (parent SKU), regular_price, attribute:pa_color (colors), AbbrLogoColor (abbreviated logo colors), attribute:pa_logo (logo colors), 
AbbrLocation (abbreviated location), and attribute:pa_location (locations).
b) The color, logo color, and location attributes may contain multiple values separated by a pipe (|). 
These are split into separate items using the split function.
c) The function then uses Python's built-in zip function to create pairs of each color, logo color, and location (abbreviated and long forms).
d) The itertools product function is used to generate all possible combinations of color, logo color, and location pairs.
e) For each combination, a dictionary is created representing a product variation. The variation includes attributes such as 
post_title, parent_sku, ID, sku, BC Count, regular_price, and meta:attribute_pa_*.
f) The product variation is then added to the combinations list.

3. Writing combinations to Excel file:
The list of combinations is converted into a DataFrame df and written to the Excel file variationsForHope.xlsx using the to_excel 
function. If there are any errors during the write operation (like PermissionError or FileNotFoundError), they are caught and an 
appropriate message is printed.

4. Important functions:
Two helper functions are used in this program:
a) abbreviate_color(color): This function takes a color string as input, removes all vowels from it, and returns the resultant string.
b) truncate_id_sections(id, delimiter='-'): This function takes an SKU ID string and a delimiter as input. The function is used to 
truncate the ID sections if the total length of the ID is more than 42 characters.
Note: In the current implementation, the function zips together tuples of the same attribute values (color with color, abbreviated 
color with long color form, etc.). However, if there's a need to create pairs of different attributes 
(for instance, color with abbreviated color), the zip function can be modified accordingly. Also, the itertools.product function is used 
to generate combinations from the tuples. For instance, if we have 2 colors, 3 locations, and 2 logo colors, it would generate 232=12 combinations.


IN SUMMARIZED FORM

This Python program's main job is to create product variations from an Excel spreadsheet. Each product has different attributes 
like colors, logo colors, and locations, each of which might have several possible values. These attributes' different combinations produce 
various versions of a product.
To find all the possible versions, the program reads each product's details from the Excel file, creates pairs of each attribute value, 
then uses a method to combine them. It also abbreviates colors by removing vowels and shortens SKU IDs if they get too long.
After all these steps, it generates an extensive list of product variations, each uniquely identified by its attributes, and writes 
this list back into a new Excel file. The program handles any file-related errors such as the inability to write to a file or a 
file not being found. In essence, it automates the process of creating multiple versions of a product based on varying attributes.
